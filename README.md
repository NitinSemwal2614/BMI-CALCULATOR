# BMI-CALCULATOR

Project Title: BMI Calculator

Description:
I've created a BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator as a web application. This project is a part of my web development journey, and it's a great way to showcase my skills. The BMI Calculator helps users calculate their BMI by inputting their weight in kilograms and height in centimeters. It then provides them with their BMI value along with an interpretation of their BMI category (underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese).
